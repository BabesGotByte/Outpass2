Our Project for Outpass Automation at IIIT-Allahabad. 
This project is basically an app which acts as the Official App of the college to automate the lenthy paperwork for trivial stuff, mainly the Leave Application, Girls Outpass(they need permission to get out of the college campus right now and the entire process is by pen and paper and a tedious process) and other Paperwork along with keeping a tab on all students coming in and out of the campus. 

A facial recognition system (using HoG, Histogram of Oriented Gradients,a deep Learning Technique) that keeps a tab on all the students moving in and out of the college gate is the major feature.  (to authenticate student, record intime and outtime and identify regular defaulters) CCTV footage used

## Working

The app accepts Outpass, Leave etc application requests, and if approved by the authority using the app, notifies the Student about it and authentificates the entries by keeping a tab on the entry/exit. This much is implemented currently


## Tech Stack

Android App Dev, Deep Learning (Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Siamese Network), Machine Learning, Firebase, Python 3

## Current Progress

Currently, the major emphasis was Outpass (Girls at IIIT Allahabad need a permission called Outpass to leave the college premises, even for trivial things like shopping, buying fruits etc), which takes rounds of paperwork, recording their in time and outtime and storing it and authentificating the student's outpass before leaving. All this is done manually and by handwritten records. We aim to automate it all using our app and Facial Recognition System (to authenticate student, record intime and outtime and identify regular defaulters and take action) (CCTV footage is taken for identifying face)

## Future Scope

This project is intended to be an app which acts as the Official App of the college and reduces all the paperwork a student has to do, making rounds around authorities and getting signatures and permission for trivial stuff. We plan to add options for Leave Application, Mess Rebate and other Official forms and applications.

We further plan to extend the Face Recognition Model so that it can take care of the institute entry exit records and can be of great use in many ways such as tracking someone, use in times of emergencies and so on.
